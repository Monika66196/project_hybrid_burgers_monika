## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Using Qiskit, this project makes a **"quantum-classical hybrid solver"** for the "1D viscous Burgers' equation."  
It shows how **variational quantum circuits** can get close to the viscous diffusion term and how a **classical solver** can deal with the nonlinear advection term.

The solver is designed with:
- **Low circuit depth** for NISQ devices  
- **Minimal qubit footprint** using amplitude encoding  
- **Noise robustness** with Aer simulation and error mitigation  
- **Scalability** to larger grids or even 2D/3D extensions

## Introduction
The one-dimensional (1D) viscous Burgers' equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation that is used as a basic model for many fluid dynamics processes, such as creating shock waves, nonlinear steepening, and viscous dissipation. This standard is used to test numerical methods because it is easier to understand than the full Navier-Stokes equations but still captures important convective-diffusive dynamics (Whitham, 1974; Burgers, 1948).

The Burgers' equation has been solved using a lot of old-fashioned numerical methods, such as finite difference methods, spectral methods, and finite element methods (Canuto et al., 2006). These methods are very accurate, but they can sometimes have trouble with steep slopes without making non-physical oscillations, especially when the Reynolds number is high (Gottlieb & Shu, 1998). Also, it is getting more and more expensive to compute high-resolution spatial discretizations, which makes them less useful for big problems and simulations that need to happen in real time.

Quantum computing has made some exciting new ideas for speeding up the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), especially with algorithms like Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and the Harrowâ€“Hassidimâ€“Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for solving linear systems (Lloyd et al., 1996; Harrow et al., 2009; Cao et al., 2019). But it is not easy to use these algorithms directly on nonlinear PDEs like the Burgers' equation because quantum evolution is inherently linear and doesn't naturally include nonlinear terms. People have suggested methods like Carleman linearization (Lubasch et al., 2020) and nonlinear-to-linear embeddings, but these often need a lot of extra qubits, have stability problems, or make approximation errors that lower accuracy.

Quantum algorithms have worked well on linear partial differential equations (PDEs), but there isn't much research on quantum methods for nonlinear PDEs, especially the Burgers' equation. Many of the studies that are already out there have some big problems. First, Carleman-based and polynomial-expansion methods don't work well with nonlinear order, which means they need too many qubits to work with current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices (Lubasch et al., 2020). Second, linearization methods make implementation easier, but they also add up approximation errors that become more of a problem over time when modeling shock-like structures. Third, a lot of hybrid quantum-classical schemes don't do a good job of balancing the computational load between quantum and classical resources, so they don't speed up performance compared to classical solvers. Finally, there isn't enough targeted benchmarking because not many existing studies carefully test quantum methods for the Burgers' equation in difficult physical situations, like high Reynolds numbers or situations where sharp gradients form, which is where classical methods usually have trouble.

##  The Burgersâ€™ Equation


We will solve the **viscous Burgers' equation**:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

Where:
- $u(x, t)$ : fluid velocity  
- $\nu$ : viscosity  

This nonlinear PDE captures phenomena like **shock waves**, **steepening**, and **diffusion**.

##  Project Goals

1. **Low circuit depth** â€“ Design shallow quantum circuits to remain viable on noisy devices.  
2. **Low qubit footprint** â€“ Use Matrix Product State (MPS)-like compression.  
3. **Minimal classical overhead** â€“ Avoid overly complex preprocessing.  
4. **Noise robustness** â€“ Use Qiskit Aer for realistic noise simulation.  
5. **Scalability** â€“ Extendable to 2D Burgersâ€™ or Navierâ€“Stokes equations.

##  Methodology

### Classical Part â€“ Advection
- Implemented using the **SSP-RK3 scheme** for stability in nonlinear advection.

### Quantum Part â€“ Diffusion
- Implemented via a **Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC)**.
- **Amplitude encoding** is used for mapping the velocity field to qubit states.
- **TwoLocal ansatz** in Qiskit provides a low-depth, parameterized circuit.

### Hybrid Time-Stepping
1. Half-step classical advection (SSP-RK3).
2. Quantum diffusion step via VQC.
3. Final half-step classical advection.

### Noise and Hardware Tests
- Simulated **noisy quantum hardware** using Qiskit Aerâ€™s noise models.
- Provided option to run on a **real IBMQ backend** for hardware verification.

## Results Summary
â€¢ Quantum diffusion matched classical reference with MSE < 1e-3.
â€¢ Circuit depth kept under 20 layers for NISQ feasibility.
â€¢ Noise simulations show ~15% improvement with error mitigation.

## Conclusion

This project showed that a "viable hybrid quantumâ€“classical approach" can be used to solve PDEs like the viscous Burgers' equation.  
Important points: - **Quantum circuits** can learn to mimic physical operators like diffusion.  
- **Classical methods** work well with nonlinear advection dynamics.  

This method looks good for **scalable fluid dynamics simulations** on quantum hardware that is coming out soon.
